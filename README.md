## Web Page created for Missing Cats G√∂teborg ( non-profit organization)

**Project Summary**

Fullstack project using Contentful (Headless CMS), Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Sass.

This project was developed for Missing Cats G√∂teborg, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping find and reunite missing cats with their owners.

The main idea behind using Contentful was to allow the organization to easily update the website content themselves, without needing technical support. This enables them to share news, success stories, and updates efficiently, helping to raise awareness and collect donations to support their mission.

The work was done voluntarily and without compensation, as a way to support their cause and contribute to their outreach efforts.
